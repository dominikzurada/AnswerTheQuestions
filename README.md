It's a terminal-based app created in Java. App allows to among other things:
* create lists of questions with answers saved in YAML text files.
* be quizzed by the application from a selected list of questions (from YAML text file) in a random order.
* be quizzed in reverse order (like you have to write correct questions for displayed answers).
* add new questions and answers to an  existing file.
